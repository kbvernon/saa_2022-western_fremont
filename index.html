QUESTION: Where do maize farmers live in an arid environment? And what can this tell us about their adaptations to climate-induced drought? 

The Fremont can help us answer this question. 

This is an important topic today for the American West and especially Utah as the state's [Department of Natural Resources](https://water.utah.gov/water-data/drought/) currently classifies 33% of its area as being in extreme drought.

The focus here is on the Western Fremont, so the frontier of the frontier.

Fremont area straddles the dividing line between the Great Basin to the west and the Colorado Plateau to the east. The former consists of dry desert basins and grassland bisected by north-south mountain ranges. This is the area I am focusing on here. If we can make sense of the Fremont who made a go of farming there, maybe they can tell us something about the viability of traditional farming in arid environments today.

- Very large area with very few sites.
- Important caveat! There's a north-south gradient of intensification: Fremont to the south are almost exclusively farmers, Fremont to the north almost exclusively foragers. 
- Fortunately, for this sort of coarse-grained analysis, this gradient of intensification may not be that important. That's because western Utah is extremely marginal and unforgiving. The mountains crop up out of the desert like islands out of the sea. That means everyone, regardless of their subsistence base, is hanging out around these highly circumscribed oases.

- The unit of analysis is the HUC10 watershed as defined by the USGS Watershed Boundary Dataset.
- Total site count is actually a count of the total number of _residential_ features at each site. 
    - Sites without residential features count as one.
    - This weighting is to address the intuitive idea that a really complex site with lots of residential architecture represents more people than an isolated pot-drop.
- The bright areas to the southeast represent the Parowan Valley, where famous Fremont sites like Evans Mound are located. The area just east of the Great Salt Lake is the Willard Wetlands, where dozens of human remains were excavated in the early nineties by Steve Simms and others.

Estimates for climate variables generated using Kyle Bocinsky's paleocar package in R. Streams cost-distance come from the hiker package in R. 

Two things to note here:
- First, cost-distance to streams is a proxy for the cost of irrigation and/or the availability of summer run-off from winter snow pack. 
- Second, as a general rule, for GDD and precipitation, higher values represented by the lighter colors are better, but for streams, lower values represented by the darker values are better.

&lt;img src="images/elevation-profile.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

???

It's important to note that the climate variables, temperature and precipitation, and even the topographic variable, cost-distance to streams, are largely driven by elevation in Utah. That's why you get these lush, green mountains rising up out of the desert. But it's also why, if you want to make a go of farming at high elevations, you have to worry about frost. So, there's a trade-off here that suggests a Goldilocks zone along the base of these ranges.

That these variables are all driven by elevation means, of course, that they are all correlated with each other. This is a thorny issue that requires careful consideration. Rather than tackle that problem here, though, let me just make two brief comments about it. 
- First, the obvious way to avoid co-linearity here is to simply regress site counts against elevation. This is unsatisfactory, however, as elevation is not explanatory. A farmer doesn't choose to live at, say, 1300 meters of elevation _because_ it's 1300 meters. Rather, they want to live at that elevation _because_ the climate is right for farming! 
- Second, we are using a generalized additive model here, so the covariates are only linearly connected through their smooth functions. That means their correlation is only problematic insofar as their smooth functions are correlated. Our analysis suggests that this is not the case, at least not to a degree that would significantly bias the model.

After fitting the model, we can define these marginal responses. You can interpret these figures as a graphical answer to the question, "In the _average_ environment, how much would site count increase or decrease with a unit change in X?"  

- As you can see, site count tends to increase with increasing GDD. Of course, as my friend Pete likes to point out, this result should be taken with a grain of salt, for it could not increase indefinitely in this way. I mean, no one is farming on the sun.  
- Precipitation has a unimodal response with an apex at approximately 500 mm of average annual rainfall. The fact that it diminishes at higher levels is probably related to the trade-off with temperature.  
- Cost-distance to streams has a small but significant effect. In general, sites increase with increasing proximity to streams.

???

Here's our reconstruction of the farming envelope in geographic space. There are three interesting take-aways here.

- First, the model suggests that the Fremont would have thrived at high density around the  Oquirrh and Stansbury Mountains to the north (the area just south of the Great Salt Lake).
- Second, the watersheds just north of the Parowan Valley are estimated to be of higher quality for the Fremont.
- But, third, there is some obvious spatial structure in the residuals, areas where the model is systematically underestimating or overestimating the total number of sites, so this may bias the result.

Used the model to estimate the distribution of Fremont in a 2d ecological space for each decade from 950 to 1340. This is a bit difficult to interpret, so let me draw your attention to three important features.

- First, the high probability or high suitability areas tend to stay in the northwest quadrant, around 2 to 400 mm of precipitation and 13 to 1500 degrees Celsius. 
- Second, the range of variation along the x-axis is extremely narrow, suggesting greater sensitivity to change in precipitation.
- Finally, the range of variation along the y-axis is much wider, suggesting less sensitivity to change in GDD.

Obvious result that confirms a popular hypothesis for farming in the southwest. The mega drought that hit the area around 1300 probably pushed the Fremont well outside this niche, thus leading to collapse.
