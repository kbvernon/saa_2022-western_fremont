QUESTION: Where do maize farmers live in an arid environment? And what can this tell us about their adaptations to climate-induced drought? 

The Fremont can help us answer this question. 

This is an important topic today for the American West and especially Utah as the state's [Department of Natural Resources](https://water.utah.gov/water-data/drought/) currently classifies 33% of its area as being in extreme drought.

The focus here is on the Western Fremont, so the frontier of the frontier.

Fremont area straddles the dividing line between the Great Basin to the west and the Colorado Plateau to the east. The former consists of dry desert basins and grassland bisected by north-south mountain ranges. This is the area I am focusing on here.

- Very large area with very few sites.
- Important caveat! There's a north-south gradient of intensification: Fremont to the south are almost exclusively farmers, Fremont to the north almost exclusively foragers. 
- For this sort of coarse-grained analysis, this gradient of intensification may not be that important. The West Desert of Utah is extremely marginal and unforgiving. The mountain ranges act like islands in a sea of nothingness. That means everyone, no matter what theyâ€™re doing, is hanging out around these rare oases. If we were modeling the whole state, meaning the Colorado Plateau, this would probably be more of an issue.

- These are HUC10 watersheds as defined by the USGS Watershed Boundary Dataset.
- Total site count is actually a count of the total number of _residential_ features at each site. 
- Sites without residential features count as one.
- This weighting is to address the intuitive idea that a really complex site with lots of residential architecture represents more people than an isolated pot-drop.
