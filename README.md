__Title:__ "The Fremont Frontier: Living at the Margins of Maize Farming"

__Authors:__ Kenneth Vernon, Jerry Spangler, Weston McCool, Peter Yaworsky, Brian Codding

__Abstract__  

Climate-induced reductions in water availability pose a serious threat to farmers in arid environments, just as it did for Fremont maize farmers living at the intersection of the Great Basin and Colorado Plateau physiographic regions. The Fremont, thus, provide an important case study to examine the resilience of ancient farmers to climatic downturns. Using a tree-ring and simulation-based reconstruction of average annual precipitation and two cost-distance measures, one to springs and the other to streams, we model spatial variability in Formative period Fremont site density. The results have implications for defining the ecological envelope in which farming is a viable strategy across this arid region and can be used to predict where and why maize farming strategies might collapse as climate changes over time.
